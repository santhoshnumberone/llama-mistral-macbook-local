🚀 Just published a hands-on guide:  
**“Run Mistral-7B Locally on MacBook M1 Using llama.cpp”**

In this guide, I show how to:
🔧 Build llama.cpp with Metal acceleration  
🧠 Load Mistral-7B (Q4_K_M GGUF) model  
💻 Run everything locally on an 8GB MacBook M1  
🛠️ No OpenAI API, No paid Colab — 100% local & free

Built as part of my learning journey into low-level LLM ops & LangChain pipeline design.

If you’re working with LLMs on local machines or optimizing for resource-limited devices, I’d love to connect and hear your thoughts!
